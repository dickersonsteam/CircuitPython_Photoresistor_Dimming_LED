# CircuitPython_Photoresistor_Dimming_LED
This program reads the analog value of a voltage divider created with a photoresistor and 1K ohm resistor. The value is scaled to control the duty cycle of a PWM pin connected to an LED. As the light level hitting the photoresistor varies, the LED's brightness varies.
